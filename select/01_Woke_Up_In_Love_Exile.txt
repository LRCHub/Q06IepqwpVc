Somewhere in the night
Fell in love with you
Wandered through my dreams
And you stole away my blues

All of a sudden a random feeling
Opened up inside
And I don't know whether
To jump through the roof
Or break right down and cry

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day
Am I still dreaming?
Is it supposed to feel this way?

Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day!

Used to run around
In no particular direction
I ran across a lot of pretty women
But I couldn't make a connection

Last night when you held me tight
You turned my life around
And I opened up my eyes this morning
Said, "Look what I found!"

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day
Am I still dreaming
Is it supposed to feel this way

Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day!

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day!
Am I still dreaming?
Is it supposed to feel this way?

Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day!

Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day!
Am I still dreaming?
Is it supposed to feel this way?

Running around with a foolish grin
Painted all over my face
Woke up in love with you
Oh, what a beautiful day!
