I woke up in this world
And I wondered how it all could be so cruel
Even though we're both afraid
I must admit I am a bit confused
As my life is passing by
It is passing with a semblance of the truth
And if I had a boy
I'd do everything to make him seem like you

I woke up in this world
And I wondered how it all could be so cruel
Even though we're both alone
I imagine I feel more alone than you
As the years are passing by
They are passing with the memories of my youth
And if I had a day
I'd do everything to spend it here with you

I woke up in this world
And I wondered how it all could be so cruel
Even though we're both afraid
I must admit I am a bit confused
As my life is passing by
It is passing with a semblance of the truth
And if I had a boy
I'd do everything to make him seem like you
