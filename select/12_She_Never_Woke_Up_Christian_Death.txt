Shifting the Sands
Hotter then Hell
Upon her lips, teardrops fell
Through the serpentine flame, I screamed her name
But she never
WOKE UP!

She never woke up

Now the finger pull, back the skin
Deaf and dumb
Dressed in black
Through the Godless Flame, I screamed her name
But she Never
WOKE UP!

She never woke up
She never woke up

Black widow
Assemble razor key(?)
When the lion lies, bygone Liege
When the smoke clears, only the blind will see
Only the blind.will see Me

She never woke up
She never woke up

Mock less helmets
Fears no man, with the flesh of my lips
Deeply in the sand
Sunset rise, Sunrise fall
The Final prayer, awaiting war

She never woke up
She never woke up
She never woke up

Philanthropist wilt
This foreign land
Thy rod, thy staff Have lost command
And through the serpentine flame
I screamed her name!
But she Never
WOKE UP!
She never woke up
She never woke up
She never woke...

These probably aren't 100% but there are none others on the web so ner =P
